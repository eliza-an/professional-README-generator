  Although the code for this challenge was written by myself, I would like to thank Trillogy Skills Bootcamp for the starter code. I would also like to thank Andrea Gates for her helpful contibution in our bootcamp slack channel, which helped me rethink how to write my code and allowed me to work more efficiently.
